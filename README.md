# Masters-Thesis-2020
The raw analysis for my master's thesis at Aalto. Discussed in more detail in the actual thesis.

The Jupyter Notebook contains the analysis. Please, refer to the thesis-analysis-final for the final version. The Python file is used to read weather data from the FMI servers. The actual consumption data is excluded.
